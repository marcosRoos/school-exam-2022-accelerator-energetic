# School Exam 2022 - Accelerator Energetic (2/3)

## Advice
This is not meant to be used as a cheat, it is meant to show part of my progress, for this reason i did not announce the name of the school and neither the exam. I hope this will only be used as a reference of my coding ability as an student.

<hr>

## Requirements 
This exercise require the developer to: 
* Create a software which can create a budget estimate based on equation : ( Unit Price * Quantity + Taxes )
<hr>

Unit price = R$ 4,50; <br><br>
Taxes:
* ICMS = 18%;
* IPI = 4%;
* PIS = 1,86%;
* COFINS = 8,54%;
 
<hr>

## Extra
Create an algorithm to give bonuses to customers.
+ i decided to give a 15% discount to customers which already spent 10 thousand or more in accelerator energetic at this month;
+ [ The Application already comes with 3 stores as a showcase ];
+ click twice on the budget row to see details;
